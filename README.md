# Pizza-App
Just a Test Pizza App

This demonstration "app" uses PHP 5+ features to allow users to order a pizza and get the price.

If the pizza fails any validation, it will throw an ItemPriceException, with the reason for the exception.

Using the system makes it easy to extend an itemElement object to create an other pizza topping, as well as add custom validations for that item/topping.

More to come...
